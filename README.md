# FastImageViewer

The only purpose of this program is to brow through pictures - fast. Today most pictures resolution is much higher than monitor's resolution. Because of this i also need a fast zoom to 100%. This viewer will zoom to 100% on left click to cursor's position. 
The only software i know that works the same way is [Fastpictureviewer](java.util.ConcurrentModificationException) - the best image browser imho.
"Fastimageviewer" is trying to create a free alternative on the one hand and it let me try JavaFX/Java8 on the other hand.
